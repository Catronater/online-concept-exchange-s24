                There was a time when children and teens could see and
                experience friends and neighbors working together to make our

                While it is true that there were the barriers of prejudice,
                oppression, and inequality in our collective history, there were
                also more chances than today for children to see people working
                together in their village.

                Community cohesion is not as visible for our youth today, with

                The Human Domino Effect is a project that involves community
                partners, schools, and families as they work together to build
                an online game that reveals what community is and how a
                well-functioning community can solve big problems.
              </p>
              <p>
                The game provides a fun opportunity for students to stack up a
                model with fun building blocks to demonstrate how we are each
                needed in the process of creating well-functioning homes,
                schools, and workplaces that combine to make great communities.
