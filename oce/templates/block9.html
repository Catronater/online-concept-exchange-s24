            <p> <span class="relationships-color"> Electrum Relationships! </span> Being a gentleman or a gentlewoman is a term that is somewhat old-fashioned. The
                definition of Gentleness can denote being moderate in action instead of harsh or severe. It also includes a thoughtful and
                measured temperament. This block is the top block on the Liberty and Humanities stack of blocks and builds upon the
                block of responsibility. This block is the culmination or completion of the nine needed elements or learning traits that help
                students live their best lives. When parents and teachers work together, to allow children and teens to experience these
                elements through the thoughtful preparation of their environment and schedule it will help them to develop meaningful
                relationships as they participate in and continue to build communities where each person has a meaningful role in solving our
                most pressing problems and living lives of optimal happiness, liberty, and health. </p>

                <p> An excellent way for children and teens to be given opportunities to practice <span class="respect-color">Respect </span> and <span class="gentleness-color"> Gentleness </span>through
                    project-based learning which involve real world projects. Volunteer work also provides opportunities to build this skill.
                    Athletics offer another great way to build strong relationships with ample opportunities to practice Respect and
                    Gentleness, which can be seen as a kind of good sportsmanship. </p>

                        vessels, and the exterior covering for monuments and buildings like the Egyptian pyramids. <span class="gentleness-color"> Gentleness </span> and <span class="relationships-color"> Respect </span>
